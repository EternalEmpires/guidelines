# Eternal Empires Guidelines

Eternal Empires operates across multiple platforms and environments, each with its own needs and expectations. To ensure a fair, respectful, and safe experience for all players and community members, weâ€™ve defined a set of guidelines tailored to each context. These guidelines are structured into three main categories:

* Eternal Empires Community Guidelines (apply to *all* platforms and interactions)
* Eternal Empires Discord Guidelines (specific to our official Discord server)
* Eternal Empires Minecraft Guidelines (specific to the in-game experience)

The **Community Guidelines** form the foundation and apply universally - whether you're interacting on Discord, in Minecraft, on our website, or in external spaces where Eternal Empires is represented.

These rules are not just recommendations; they are binding for all participants. They are designed to protect the integrity of the project, ensure respectful behavior, and provide a safe environment for players, creators, and staff alike.

**Violations** of any of these guidelines may lead to actions including, but not limited to:

* Temporary or permanent suspensions
* Removal of in-game privileges or roles
* Exclusion from community spaces
* Revocation of content creator or partner status

In particularly severe cases - including threats, harassment, data misuse, or criminal activity - **Eternal Empires reserves the right to escalate matters and cooperate with relevant authorities or law enforcement agencies.**

By participating in Eternal Empires in any form, you agree to follow these rules and contribute to a positive, constructive, and fair environment for everyone involved.
